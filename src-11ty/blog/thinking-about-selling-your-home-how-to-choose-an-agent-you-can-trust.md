  Selling your home is more than just putting a sign in the yard—it’s about protecting your equity and avoiding costly surprises.** While many agents sound the same, trustworthy agents stand out by clearly explaining pricing, guiding sellers away from unnecessary expenses, preparing them for challenges, and encouraging informed decision-making. The right agent focuses on clarity, communication, and risk management—whether or not you’re ready to sell today.

# Thinking About Selling Your Home?

How to Choose an Agent You Can Trust\*\*

If you’re thinking about selling your home, even if it’s months away, you’ve probably realized something uncomfortable: **every real estate agent sounds the same.**

They all promise top dollar.
They all say they’re “great negotiators.”
They all seem confident.

And yet, choosing the wrong agent can cost you time, money, and unnecessary stress.

So how do you know who you can actually trust?

## **Start With This Truth**

Selling your home isn’t just a transaction—it’s a **risk management exercise**.

Your agent’s real job is not just to sell, but to:

* **Protect your equity**
* **Reduce uncertainty**
* **Anticipate problems before they show up**

## **What Trustworthy Agents Do Differently**

**1. They explain their pricing strategy clearly**
Not just a number, but *why* that number works in today’s market.

**2. They tell you what won’t help**
Good agents save you from unnecessary upgrades and wasted money.

**3. They prepare you for the uncomfortable parts**
Appraisals, inspections, negotiations—no surprises.

**4. They welcome comparison**
They expect you to interview multiple agents and help you ask better questions.

## **Questions Every Seller Should Ask an Agent**

* How do you determine the right price—not just the list price?
* How do you handle multiple offers or low offers?
* What problems do you see most often during escrow?
* How will you communicate with me during the process?

If an agent avoids these questions, that tells you something.

## **Final Thought**

If you’re not ready to sell yet, that’s okay.
The smartest sellers start with **clarity**, not commitment.

A good agent will help you understand your options, whether or not you ever list your home with them.
